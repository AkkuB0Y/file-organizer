# file-organizer
Learning Scripting with Bash, and organizing my (very dirty) downloads folder in the process!

Feel free to fork if you also wish to organize your downloads the way I did:

# Steps:

1. cd into the folder with the file.
2. enter ```chmod +x file_organizer.sh``` into your terminal to make the script executable.
3. run ```./file_organizer.sh``` to exectue the script.
4. Enjoy!
